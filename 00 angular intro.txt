Angular 


What version ?

Angular first rolled out AngularJs i.e. Angular version 1

Then team decided that its not really good , we need scrape it off 
and write it from a scratch.

Then they rolled out Angular i.e. Angular version 2

Then what happened there was no backward compatibility
everything that we write in Angular 2 is going to be completely
breaking changes what happens in Angular 1
This brings a lot of confusion in the community
should I be learning Angular 2 or AngularJs or Angular 5 or Angular 6 or Angular 9

We don't need to worry of that in 2020 or in moving forward in the future
Whatever we learning in the Angular (i.e version Angular 9 but this version will be fine for upward versions too) from this version and onwards there will be 
absolutely minimum backward breaking changes that gonna break our code.


Why Angular is considered as Complex ?

Compared to other libraries similar to this like react, Angular is bit more complex.

Some says ...
	...there are too much things to learn
	...there is a involvement of typescript
	...there is a involvement of RxJs
	
The whole reason behind why Angular is complex...
	...too many of the jargon keywords
		.Components
		.Modules
		.Directives
		.Pipes
		.Dependency Injection
		.Services
		.Routing
